# Deep-Learning-Project
Rock Paper Scissors Classifier: 
Adopting prominent convolutional neural network ResNet to detect the image to classify it to either rock, paper, and scissors with an accuracy of 99%.
Utilizing data sets in the TensorFlow API to build the data pipeline to preprocess the data using the data augmentation technique.
Train the network with a custom training loop to train more efficiently.
